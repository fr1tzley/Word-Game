# word-game
A fun Python word game. The game generates a random grid of letters that are then translated into PySimpleGUI buttons. 

Each button's key is a handler method generated by a class based on the letter itself, as well as it's specific position in the grid. When a button is pressed, all other buttons 
except those adjacent and diagnoal from it are disabled. Letter generation is weighed according to how common letters are in English.

When a word is submitted, it is searched up via NLTK WordNet and, if it exists, scored according to Scrabble rules.
